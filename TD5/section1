A technique used in some processors with instruction prefetch to guess whether a conditional branch will be taken or not and prefetch code from the appropriate location.
When a branch instruction is executed, its address and that of the next instruction executed (the chosen destination of the branch)
 are stored in the Branch Target Buffer. This information is used to predict which way the instruction
 will branch the next time it is executed so that instruction prefetch can continue.

A method whereby a processor guesses the outcome of a branch instruction so that it can prepare in advance to carry out the instructions that follow the predicted outcome.

If the CPU guesses the wrong branch, it will take extra machine cycles to go back and execute the correct one; however, on average, if the prediction algorithms are good, overall performance is increased.
